                    Compositional CompCert
                    ======================

OVERVIEW: 

This directory contains files accompanying the POPL submission

                    Compositional CompCert.

The files are distributed as a modification of standard CompCert 2.1:
The compiler files are the same but there are two sets of proofs, one
for standard CompCert and the second for Compositional CompCert.  Both
sets of proofs are buildable.

In general, files suffixed with *_coop, *_eff, or *EFF are the
compositional versions of the standard CompCert proofs. The
compositional proofs can typically be found in the same directory as
their standard CompCert counterparts.


BUILDING:

Compositional CompCert builds under Coq 8.4pl4+Ssreflect 1.5. If you
do not have Ssreflect, you will be able to build everything but the
files in the linking/ subdirectory (horizontal composition/proofs) 
and driver/CompilerComplements.v, which depends on linking/.

To build, unzip the .tgz file, go to the root directory, and type:
  ./configure [build-target, e.g., ia32-cygwin]
  touch .depend
  make depend
  make proof


FILES:

The files and directories most relevant to the paper are:

cfrontend/ 
  C frontend compiler phases and proofs (SimplLocals, Cshmgen,
  Cminorgen). Files suffixed *_eff.v and *_coop.v gives 
  language definitions. Files suffixed *EFF.v are the compositional 
  compiler phase proofs.

backend/ 
  Backend compiler phases and proofs (Selection, RTLgen, Tailcall,
  Renumbering, Allocation, Tunneling, Linearize, CleanupLabels,
  Stacking, Asmgen). Files suffixed *_eff.v and *_coop.v gives language
  definitions. Files suffixed *EFF.v are the compositional compiler
  phase proofs.

core/
  core_semantics.v: defines interaction semantics, Sec. 2 
  StructuredInjections.v: structured injections, Sec. 4
  effect_simulations.v: structured simulations, Sec. 4
  effect_simulations_trans.v: Theorem 1 (transitivity), Sec. 5
  
linking/
  compcert_linking.v: defines linking semantics, Sec. 3
  linking_spec.v: states Theorem 2, Sec. 5
  linking_proof.v: proves Theorem 2, Sec. 5
  context_equiv.v: defines reach-closed contextual equivalence and
    proves Corollary 1, Sec. 5

driver/
  CompositionalCompiler.v: proves Theorem 3, Sec. 6
  CompositionalComplements.v: proves Corollary 2, Sec. 6

scripts/
  Contains the shell scripts used to calculate the line counts in
  Sec. 6. In general, we calculate lines of spec. vs. proof 
  by first classifying whole files as either spec. or proof, 
  and then just using wc. The coqwc tool is an alternative, but 
  it often seems to undercount proof lines and overcount 
  spec. lines.

                The CompCert C verified compiler

OVERVIEW:

The CompCert C verified compiler is a compiler for a large subset of the
C programming language that generates code for the PowerPC, ARM and x86
processors.

The distinguishing feature of CompCert is that it has been formally
verified using the Coq proof assistant: the generated assembly code is
formally guaranteed to behave as prescribed by the semantics of the
source C code.

CompCert is an ongoing research project.  The present release is an
advanced prototype intended for research, educational and evaluation
purposes.

For more information on CompCert (supported platforms, supported C
features, installation instructions, using the compiler, etc), please
